Findings showed that 20-24 year olds have the highest average total purchases, but those numbers drop dramatically from the ages of 25-29.
Men make the majority of purchases but many of those items have a low price tag of $4 or less.  Top spenders spend between $12 and $17 
dollars for an item and the most popular items appear to have a low price point.
